USAGE OF snippets.html

In this file are html snippets stored. They are not used during runtime, but for development.
The js generates the html, but I write the snippets by hand in this html file, to enable
syntax highlighting and auto completion by the IDE (Aptana Studio 3).

Of course the script shouldn't generate static html. The variables, that are inserted are
marked here with hash tags. First this static code gets copied into the skript as a String.
After that, the tags get replaced with the desired variables.

example:
html_snippet.replace(/#id/g, object.id)
...replaces ALL #id tags

html_snippet.replace("#id", object.id)
...replaces ONLY THE FIRST #id tag
